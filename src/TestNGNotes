TestNG Class 1 - 5/8/22

TestNG is a testing tool that helps structure test cases using different annotations.
It can be integrated with Cucumber, Maven, and Selenium.

Benefits of TestNG
1. Reports
2. Annotations (e.g. @Test, @BeforeMethod, @BeforeClass)
3. Parallel Testing
4. Batch Execution
5. Assertions (Hard, Soft)
6. Data Parameterization

ANNOTATIONS
-- do not need a main method
-- a tag that provides additional information about a class, interface, or method in TestNG

@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass

@Test --> test case. You should write your test cases under this annotation.
@BeforeMethod --> executed before test case or before the main method
